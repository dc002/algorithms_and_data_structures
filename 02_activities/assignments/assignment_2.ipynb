It is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(n), since each character is processed once and the stack may grow to the size of the input in the worst case.

    "Working through all these Python solutions has been both challenging and rewarding. As a beginner learning Python, the learning curve has been steep — starting from simple built-in functions like print() and progressing all the way to building binary trees. Each problem offered multiple ways to approach a solution, and every assignment pushed me to think critically about logic, structure, and efficiency.\n",
    "I’ve gained a deeper understanding of core programming concepts like recursion, stack operations, and time and space complexity — not just how they work, but why they matter. One of the biggest takeaways was realizing how different approaches — such as recursion vs. iteration, or nested loops vs. linear iteration — can solve the same problem, each with its own trade-offs.\n",
    "I also learned how to write cleaner, more maintainable code by using dictionaries, simplifying return statements, and avoiding hardcoded values. The final assignment even introduced opportunities to build reusable classes, which helped me think more modularly and design code with scalability in mind.\n",
    "Beyond technical skills, this process helped me build confidence in debugging, testing, and clearly explaining my reasoning — which is just as important as writing the code itself. Overall, writing these solutions has strengthened my problem-solving mindset and made me more comfortable tackling unfamiliar challenges with a structured and thoughtful approach."
